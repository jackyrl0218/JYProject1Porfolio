      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Jack Yuan, a sophomore majoring in Design &amp; Technology at Parsons School of Design. Originally from the vibrant city of Shanghai, China, I've grown up immersed in a rich blend of tradition and modern innovation. This unique background fuels my passion for exploring the intersection of creative design and emerging technology.</p>
      <p>At Parsons, I am dedicated to developing my skills in interactive design, digital storytelling, and experimental media. I love tackling challenges that push the boundaries between art and technology, and I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that spark new ideas and innovative solutions. Whether through creative coding, immersive installations, or thoughtful design, I strive to craft experiences that engage and inspire.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to sharing my journey, my work, and my vision for the future of design and technology with you.</p>
